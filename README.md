SARIMA modeling of Time Series Sea-level data from NASA in R

Data Source
The Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) data was computed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center under the auspices of the NASA MEaSUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) program. The GMSL was generated by measuring sea surface heights from a number of satellites to a common terrestrial reference frame. More information regarding the data source is in the References section.
